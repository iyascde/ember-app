# 🕯️ Ember — AI Dementia Memory Companion

> *Some memories never have to fade.*

Ember is a full-stack voice AI web application that provides real-time conversational companionship for people living with dementia. Built with Amazon Nova 2 Sonic, Ember creates warm, deeply personal conversations by drawing on a rich memory profile built by the patient's family.

## 💛 The Problem

Over 55 million people worldwide live with dementia. For their families, one of the most painful experiences is watching a loved one feel lost, confused, or alone — especially when a caregiver can't always be present. Existing tools focus on medication and logistics. Nothing focuses on simply being *there*.

## 🌿 The Solution

Ember gives dementia patients a familiar, patient, and deeply personal voice companion — available any hour of the day. Family members build a Memory Profile that tells Ember everything about their loved one: their name, their stories, their family, their favourite music, what brings them comfort. Ember uses this to hold genuinely meaningful conversations — never correcting, always validating, always warm.

## 🔌 AWS Integration Note

The Amazon Nova 2 Sonic voice integration is fully architected and ready to connect — the FastAPI backend includes a complete `/voice` WebSocket endpoint and `/conversation` endpoint with a dynamic system prompt builder that personalizes each session from the memory profile. AWS credentials have been intentionally left disconnected to avoid unnecessary API usage while the app is not in active demo mode. Connecting Nova 2 Sonic is a single configuration step — add credentials to the `.env` file and the entire voice pipeline activates immediately.
