# 🕯️ Ember — AI Dementia Memory Companion

> *Some memories never have to fade.*

Ember is a full-stack voice AI web application that provides real-time conversational companionship for people living with dementia. Built with Amazon Nova 2 Sonic, Ember creates warm, deeply personal conversations by drawing on a rich memory profile built by the patient's family.

## 💛 The Problem

Over 55 million people worldwide live with dementia. For their families, one of the most painful experiences is watching a loved one feel lost, confused, or alone — especially when a caregiver can't always be present. Existing tools focus on medication and logistics. Nothing focuses on simply being *there*.

## 🌿 The Solution

Ember gives dementia patients a familiar, patient, and deeply personal voice companion — available any hour of the day. Family members build a Memory Profile that tells Ember everything about their loved one: their name, their stories, their family, their favourite music, what brings them comfort. Ember uses this to hold genuinely meaningful conversations — never correcting, always validating, always warm.
